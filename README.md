# Time.exe

Basically, a game about time, timeline merging and godly shenanigans, if it wasn't so chaotic 
*(and also open source + cross platform + multiplayer, local multiplayer, all in the future, for now)*

Extremely WIP, as for right now it is simply a prototype

UPDATE (22/9/2025): Due to studying and some other works, this project will be abandoned (either temporarily or permanently, that's only up to me for now), also simply because I DON'T HAVE TIME nor the people in order to do this, since it's a very big idea and there's only me doing this so it'll stay this way for a very long time and could be archived later on
